## About
I am a dynamic developer with two years of hands-on experience in the world of software development. My passion for creating efficient and innovative solutions has led me to explore a wide array of technologies. My technical expertise consists of the following, C#, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Dart, and TypeScript. I have work experience with the following frameworks, .NET, React, Angular, and Flutter. I am familiar and got certifications in the two most popular cloud services AWS and Azure, I use them both to deliver scalable and reliable applications. As an advocate for simpler and quicker development I have started exploring low code development tools such as Flutter Flow, Zoho Creator, and Out Systems. My journey in the tech world has been a constant learning process, and I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with you. Whether it's coding, experimenting with new technologies, or building innovative applications, I'm always up for the challenge.
